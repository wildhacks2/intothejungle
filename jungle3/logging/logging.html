      Logging, also known as deforestation, is the action of clearing a wide area of trees. The following are some of the
      effects
    </h1>

    <h1 id="title">1. Loss of biodiversity</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">
      Species lose their habitat. Endemic species unable to survive anywhere
      else. Thus, population dwindle and will eventually become extinct.
    </h2>

    <br /><br />

    <h1 id="title">2. Habitat degradation</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">
      Deforestation leads to fragmentation of rainforest, which in turn affect
      species structure, composition and microclimate. This results in
      rainforest being more vulnerable to droughts and fires, which negatively
      affect species that are unable to cope.
    </h2>

    <br /><br />

    <h1 id="title">3. Loss of water cycling</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">
      Deforestation reduces water cycing services provided by trees. This can
      lead to increased possibility of droughts and fires which may wipe out
      endemic species.
