    <h1 id="header">Logging, also known as deforestation. The following are some of the effects</h1>

    <h1 id="title">1. Loss of biodiversity</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">Species lose their habitat. Endemic species unable to survive anywhere else. Thus, population dwindle and will eventually become extinct.</h2>
    
    <br><br>

    <h1 id="title">2. Habitat degradation</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">Deforestation leads to fragmentation of rainforest, which in turn affect species structure, composition and microclimate. This results in rainforest being more vulnerable to droughts and fires, which negatively affect species that are unable to cope.</h2>
    
    <br><br>

    <h1 id="title">3. Loss of water cycling</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">Deforestation reduces water cycing services provided by trees. This can lead to increased possibility of droughts and fires which may wipe out endemic species.</h2>
