      Mining is the process of obtaining coal or other minerals from a mine. The
      following are some of the effects
    </h1>

    <h1 id="title">1. Deforestation</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">
      Wood from surrounding forest is cut for charocal to fuel mining processes.
      Species lose their habitat. Endemic species unable to survive anywhere
      else. Thus, population dwindle and will eventually become extinct.
    </h2>

    <br /><br />

    <h1 id="title">2. Pollution</h1>
    <h2 id="explain">
      Run-off from mine will pollute surrounding water which will threaten both
      the species living in it and species that feed on it. Heavy metals will be
      present in run-off which is poisonous to animals. Animals consume the
      water or animals in the water (e.g. fishes), will then die due to being
      poisoned. May lead to extinction of species.
